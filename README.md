# JOURNEY ON BUILDING A CONTROLLER FOR BLDC MOTORS
*my special thanks to my colleague, my master, my teacher, my mentor, Mr. NghÄ©a at Apicoo Robotics JSC., without whose support I couldn't have made it this far.*

<div style="text-align: justify">In this journey, I shall note down certain key knowledge about BLDC control, as well as some about embedded programming on the STM32 arm platform that I acquired along the way. What I shall NOT mention, however, are the fundamental theory of BLDC motors and mathetmatical theories of the herein mentioned control methods.</div>
